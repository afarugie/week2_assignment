This is my assignment for Week 2 of the Summer of Ruby 2016 course.

TODO: further test all files.  Recreate the menu with TDD. Remove logic
from menu.rb ( converting cents to dollars )
ISSUES: If a user presses enter without selecting an item, 
the first item (index 0) will be added to the cart. 

Questions: Is it proper to specify 'self.' when calling an instance method
from inside another instance method?" (example https://github.com/afarugie/week2_assignment/blob/master/lib/menu.rb#L20 )
